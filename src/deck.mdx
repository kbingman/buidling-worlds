# Building Worlds

Exploring Exoplanets with Javascript

## About Me

* Front End Tech Lead here at Unbounce

---

* The last math class I took was in High School
* But I did take lots of Astronomy in University 

---

## Intro
* A few caveats...
* I am not a data scientist, I have no idea
* There aren't any fancy graphics, we're just building with numbers here
---

# A Little History

---

## Star Trek

---

import startrek from './images/startrek.png';

<Image src={startrek}></Image>

---

import vaal from './images/startrek-the-apple-1.png';

<Image src={vaal}></Image>

---

* Paper Mache Sets
* HorriblePlanets
* Really Bad Costumes

---

import vaal2 from './images/startrek-the-apple.png';

# Star Wars

---

import tatooine from './images/starwars-tatooine-3.png';

<Image src={tatooine}></Image>

---

* Planets were based on real places 
* Prettier planets (Tatooine, Hoth, Degoba)
* Still pretty one dimensional

## (Example goes here)

---

## Accrete
In 1969 Stephen H. Dole published  
“Formation of Planetary Systems   
by Aggregation: A Computer Simulation”.

---

* Originally written in the 1960’s to simulate the creation of solar systems
* Carl Sagan later contributed to it
* Sample size of one, tuned to re-create our solar
* Ported to C, C++, Java and Javascript

import accrete from './images/accrete.png';

---

## (Example goes here)

---

## Also... 
it was actually the first time I used linked lists

---

## January 9th, 1992
The exo-planet was discovered

---

## Everything Changed
They were really really weird


---

* Radial Velocity
* Timing
* Microlensing
* Imaging
* Primary Transit
* Other
* Secondary Transit

---

## 4,043 Confirmed Exoplanets

## Definitions

---

### AU = Astronomical Unit

---

### M⊙︎ = Solar Mass
2×10^30 kg

---

### M⊕ = Earth Mass

---

## Planetary Types
* Jovian - Gas Giant
* Neptunian - Ice Giant
* Mini Neptune - (sometimes called Super Terran)
* Terran - Rocky (not necessarily habital)

Examples  
Way more entertaining than I am
